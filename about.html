          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
        Hello! I am an aspiring Data Journalist who has a passion for visually and rhetorically communicating data that pervade our everyday lives.
        Whether it be sports, politics, economics, or even music, I am striving to tell compelling and thoughtful digtial stories about our world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am interested in mastering all the skills that are essential to all parts of the data journalism process in the hope that I can eventually contribute to the stories a newsroom produces. This process includes gathering data via APIs, webscraping, and other collection methods; preparing data through wrangling/cleaning tools, analyzing data utilizing arithmetic and statistical methods; and presenting data with visualizations and news applications. My goal is to be able to completely reproduce the workflow of a newsroom's data team from raw data to publishable content for readers.
          <p>
        I have experience in R with a variety of Tidyverse packages such as dplyr and stringr for data cleaning, manipulation, and wrangling and ggplot2 for data visualization. I have used modelR and moderndive to do correlation, multiple and logistic regression. I also have worked in Python with Pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and wrangling along with base Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for visualization. I have utilized scipy in Python for statistical regression as well along with BeautifulSoup and requests for web scraping data. Additionally, I have utilized both Tableau for data analysis and visualzaion and PostgreSQL for intermediate SELECT queries, data cleaning, and basic database management and statistics.
