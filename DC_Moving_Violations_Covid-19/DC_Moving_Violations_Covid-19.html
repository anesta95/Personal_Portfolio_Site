<p>Almost three months after Governor Hogan, Governor Northam, and Mayor Bowser’s issuance of stay-at-home orders, it is starting to become apparent just how much the pandemic has impacted transportation in the Washington region. WMATA has <a class = "article-links" href="https://www.wmata.com/service/covid19/covid-19-public-information.cfm">documented</a> an over 90% reduction in Metro ridership and 70% reduction in MetroBus ridership in the month of April. Uber ridership is down <a class="article-links" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/19/uber-coronavirus-analyst-call/">as much as 70%</a> in many metropolitan areas, including DC. Thanks to Metro PD data available through the <a class = "article-links" href="https://opendata.dc.gov/">Open Data DC portal</a>, we know that vehicle moving violations throughout the city have been impacted as well. However, contrary to the conventional wisdom of a decrease in since the outbreak of Covid-19, violations have in fact risen from March and April of this year as compared to last year. Overall, year-over-year moving violations have increased 37.9% in March, followed by another spike of 17.4% in April.</p>

<p>The breakout of year-over-year citations by Ward gives some insight into where these fluctuations in violations are occurring. The percentage change of violations from February 2019 to 2020 were pretty stable across all the Wards except for a 25.9% increase in Ward 5 being offset by a 27.2% and 33.1% decrease in violations in Ward 6 and 8, respectively. In March, as general shutdowns and closures started to sweep the city, most Wards had either minor increases or decreases over last year. However, Wards 5, 8, and especially Ward 6 saw massive increases over the prior year of 55.7%, 97.1%, and 222%, respectively. Lastly, April saw most Wards reflect a moderate decline in moving violations, with Wards 5 and 8 bucking that trend and experiencing a 34.6% and 117% increase, respectively. The rise of violations in specific Wards, notably Ward 6 and Ward 8, were the driving force behind the overall year-over-year rise in both March and April from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
<p>Looking into the most frequent citation location for each month, it’s clear the driving habits of DC drivers changed starting in March. The most frequent location of moving violation citations in February through April of 2019 and February of 2020 was 600 Kenilworth Avenue, NE, which is the location of what has been the <a class="article-links" href="https://www.dcpolicycenter.org/publications/speed-cameras-in-d-c/">highest revenue producing</a> speed camera in the city. However, in March 2020 the speed camera on I-395 going eastbound after exit 4 (Maine Avenue by Nats Park) was by far the most frequent location with 27,691 citations. The speed camera at this location alone made up just over 19% of the citations given in that month and had over twice as many citations as the next most frequent location across the six months of February through April in 2019 and 2020. In April, the main factor behind the major increase in Ward 8 violations was due to the 12,937 that were issued solely by the speed camera on I-295 going southbound about 0.4 miles south of exit 2 (South Capital Street/JB Anacostia-Bolling Naval station).</p>

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
<p>In terms of what types of moving violations constitute these changes in the past few months, the bulk of violations that are committed are for speeding, specifically travelling 11-15 mph over the speed limit. Speeding violations of that speed range increased by 41.1% from March 2019 to March 2020 and by 47.4% for all speeding violations. Additionally, 11-15mph speeding violations rose 15.8% and 21.1% for all speeding violations between April 2019 and 2020.</p>

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
<p>The overwhelming majority of these speeding tickets are given out by Metro PD’s Special Operations and Traffic Division via the various <a class="article-links" href="https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/camera-enforcement-locations">automated speed and red light cameras</a> across town.</p>

<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-9 col-sm-12">
<p>As the Covid-19 pandemic began to set in throughout the DC region, data shows that instead of moving violations decreasing, drivers collected more moving violations throughout both March and April. Moreover, these increases have been driven in large part due to significant boosts in speeding violations, especially on I-395 eastbound into Ward 6 and the I-295 corridor in Ward 8.</p>
